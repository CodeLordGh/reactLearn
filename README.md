# ReactLearn

In this reactLearn repository I try building single component applications
to enforce my understanding and capability in reactjs.

Each application is component in the compents directory.

This template should help you get started with my ReactLearn

Each project is a component in the component folder. You can choose to comment or
not some components so that you can work with the component you want.
